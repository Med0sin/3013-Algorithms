## Banner Page

Bring banner with [A04](../03-A04/README.md), but still create A03 folder and README and list it in your assignments folder.

### Overview

- We need a way to print out our program banner cover pages to put on assignments. I found a VSCode Extension called  `Banner Comments +` that will let us do it right in the editor. 

- Install `Banner Comments +` by clicking on the extensions icon on the left:
  
- Open VSCode Extensions:

- Search then install the Banner Comments+ extension:

- After it's installed, set the default font by pressing `shift + ctrl + p` 
- Then type `banner` which gives you all the banner commands.
- Then choose set default font.

- Set the default font as any of the `big money` fonts
- We can change it, if someone finds a better one.

- Then in any file you can type some text, **highlight it**.
- Type `shift + ctrl + p` 
- Choose `BannerComments: Apply` 
- It will change (for example ) the text below into a banner!

- Create your own banner:

```txt
A03
2143
YOURLASTNAME
```

- Side note: The banner comments doesn't work in markdown files (like this one). It expects source code files like `cpp`,  `h` , or `py` files.
- ~~Print it out and turn it in beginning of class Wednesday with your commented code!~~
  - Just bring it with your commented code on Friday.
  - But make sure you still upload as instructed next.
- You should upload it to github as well in a folder: `A03` that would also be in your assignments folder.
